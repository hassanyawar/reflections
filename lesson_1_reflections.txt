Q. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A. diff helps by showing the difference in text by comparing lines. The lines which have different text are pointed out in the terminal along with the text.

Q. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A. If we want to revert to some older file then we can easily select from the entire history of the file. Or we can review some older file just for some references.

Q. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A. You have complete control of your versions. This way you can avoid creating unnecessary commits making the revision history too cluttery. Or increase your commit frequency if automatically frequency was too low.

Q. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A. If one file is connected with another file some way then saving multiple files in one commit makes sense. In case of Google Docs, each document file is independant so we don't exactly need multiple file commit.

Q. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A. By using 'git log' we can see the history of different commits. And using the commit ID in the log we can see the difference in between two different commits.

Q. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A. We could always revert back to previous version if any accidental unknown bug is introduced. Or we can check the version difference to see which lines introduced the bug.

Q. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A. To keep revision record.
