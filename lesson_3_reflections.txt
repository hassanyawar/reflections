Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. With remote repository you can share your repository with other user or you can work on different local machine and download your repository to that one and continue with your work.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. It gives you complete control. If any bug is introduced by accident then it won't be pulled on your local repository.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A. Forking is when you clone a repository from someone else's github profile to your profile. Cloning is when you copy a repository from your github profile to your local working system. Branching is to make such commit which will create another branch from the commit history so that any new changes in that branch will not affect the master branch.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A. With this user can see the changes done by different collaborators without having local changes affected by those changes.
