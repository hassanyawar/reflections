Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. With remote repository you can share your repository with other user or you can work on different local machine and download your repository to that one and continue with your work.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. It gives you complete control. If any bug is introduced by accident then it won't be pulled on your local repository.
